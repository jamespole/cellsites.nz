                <figcaption>An overview of the north-eastern corner of the mast. If you arrive at this site by road and walk from the carpark at the end of Eyre Road this is the view you will see first. The two mobile phone antenna arrays can be found approx one-third up the mast.</figcaption>

                    The Optus/Vodafone antenna array can be found near the top-right corner.
                    The Telstra antenna array can be found below the Optus/Vodafone array.
                    There is also a lone antenna near the the bottom-left corner, which seems to belong to Telstra.

My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_10#Logo_and_identity_history">research</a> suggests they stopped using this logo in 1984&mdash;nearly 40 years prior to this photo being taken! Also, of amusing interest is the statement regarding guard dogs&mdash;they must have been off-duty the day I visited.</figcaption>
